# twitter-crawler
Tweets capture, storage and analysis

This project is a school projet meant to learn and practice concepts of Operating System such as multithreading or network.
The goal is to create a Java application able to connect on Twitter, capture tweets and apply the HIST algorithm on these data.

We'll use the Twitter4J library, licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, Copyright 2007 Yusuke Yamamoto and without any modification.

## Getting started
To be able to use this twitter-crawler, you need to create a twitter4j.properties file in the bin repertory filled with your twitter's authentication-keys like this :

>`oauth.consumerKey =       **********`<br>
>`oauth.consumerSecret =    **********`<br>
>`oauth.accessToken =       **********`<br>
>`oauth.accessTokenSecret = **********`<br>

You can get theses keys by creating a new twitter application.
